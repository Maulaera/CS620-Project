## Project: Analysis of University Admissions 
<u>*Project Idea*</u>

Our project will involve analyzing university admissions. We will collect data regarding test score requirements, GPAs, demographics, and admission rates. With this data, we will analyze different trends between colleges regarded as Ivy League and typical four-year colleges.

Along with that analysis, we will construct a program that takes inputted student statistics and outputs an estimated probability of getting accepted into a difficult school and which areas to focus on for improvement.

<u>*Sprints*</u>

We will keep track of our work using a simple sprint goal chart. Each sprint includes what we want to accomplish and the deadline the sprint will finish. We have also decided to use GitHub and VSCode for the creation of our visualizations and program, as we are the most comfortable and familiar with these tools. We will continue to reference back to this Google Colab for updates and sprint tracking.

Sprint 0 - Feb 9th - Submit Abstract and decide on IDE.

Sprint 1 - March 2nd - Create Github, Data wrangling and begin visualizations.

Sprint 2 - March 30th - Finalize visualizations and begin programming.

Sprint 3 - April 27th - Finish Program and Final Report.
